h2. What's the difference between merge and rebase

<pre>
    
Master and branch that have diverged

          o-o-o <- branch
         /
    o-o-o-o-o <- master
    
Merge
           Merge point
                |
          o-o-o-o <- branch
         /     /
    o-o-o-o-o <- master
    
Rebase

              o-o-o <- branch
             /
    o-o-o-o-o <- master
</pre>   
    
    
Rebase is used when you have a topic branch you want to keep up to date then merge back to the original branch on your local repository.
 
Merge can also be used for this locally but merge is the recommended to get new changes in to a long lived branch living on the remote repository.


h2. Merge

* git merge branch   # Currently in master
    
h2. Rebase

* git rebase master  # Currently in topic branch
