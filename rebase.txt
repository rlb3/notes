# What's the difference between merge and rebase

              o-o-o <- branch
             /
        o-o-o-o-o <- master
    
# Merge

             /     /
        o-o-o-o-o <- master
    
# Rebase

                  o-o-o <- branch

**Rebase is used when you have a topic branch you want to keep up to date then merge back to the original branch on your local repository.  
Merge can also be used for this locally but merge is the recommended to get new changes in to a long lived branch living on the remote repository.**

# Merge
        git merge branch   # Currently in master
    
# Rebase
        git rebase master  # Currently in topic branch

# Rebase Interactive
    git rebase -i master    # Rebasing interactively
                            # means that you have a chance
                            # to edit the commits which are
                            # rebased. You can reorder the
                            # commits, and you can remove
                            # them (weeding out bad or
                            # otherwise unwanted patches).
